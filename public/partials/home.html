                Our Auto-DJ Software is an improvement on the fade-out/fade-in algorithms that programs like Spotify and iTunes use to mix together songs in a playlist. Our algorithm will allow the user to import a batch of MP3 or WAV audio files, and will determine the best order to play the songs in according to tonal center and BPM of the song. The algorithm will “beatmatch” the songs and overlay them so that one song seamlessly transitions into the next. Additionally, algorithm will slowly change the tempo from one song to the next so that changes in speed cannot be noticed.

            <p>
                Setting a playlist to flow from song to song seamlessly prevents the listener from being distracted by interruptions in the flow of the music. Having an automated software switch songs does not tie down any specific person to manage the music. The software will also be able to tell which songs go well together, and rearrange the playlist to have the most natural flow. It will be able to change speeds at a rate that the people listening will have a hard time even noticing the changes. A unique feature of our planned algorithm is that it attempts to avoid clashes in frequencies between the songs. It will attempt to remove certain frequencies from the incoming song where the current song has the most energy. For example, The software will remove any frequencies under 250 Hz of the incoming song to allow the bass and kick drum from the current song to continue to stand out. Once the two are playing in time, it will slowly remove the frequencies from the old track and bring the new track to full volume.

                We will compare the actual BPM of the song to the BPM detected by our software. We will also record the time it takes to analyze a batch of songs before playback can begin. Because beatmatching is our most important function, we score correct BPM detection with the highest weight. We will also score how often the audio clips or distorts due to clashing frequencies between the two songs.
            </p>
            <p>
                We will gather a group of test subjects and present a transition between two songs using different music softwares. We can compare the basic “crossfade” on iTunes or Spotify, the auto fade of VirtualDJ, a human DJ transition, and our AutoDJ software. We will ask subjects which example they thought was the smoothest (which seemed to “flow” the best). We can take an average of the results and see how our software holds up to the other methods.

            <h4>

            </h4>
            <p>
                The fade-in and fade-out portions of the program will allow us to slowly change the volume of each track at the beginning and end respectively. Each function will accept an audio file, a fade beginning sample number, and a fade end sample number. The function will then create the fade-in or fade-out using a triangular amplitude filter.

            </p>
            <h4>
                Filtering
            </h4>
            <p>
                The song filtering portion of the program will allow us to remove certain parts of the frequency range from the beginning or end of each song to facilitate a better song blend. The function will accept an audio file, a type of filter (low-pass or high-pass), a filter beginning, and a filter end. The function will then remove the selected portions of the frequency spectrum from the specified time interval, and will reconstruct the audio with the changes implemented.
            </p>
            <h4>
                Interface
            </h4>
            <p>
                The interface is secondary and will only be built if we are able to perfect the python code. If we do implement a web interface, it will be written using Angular.JS and Bootstrap.

                We have found a few tools that will help us greatly assist us in this project. We will be using Librosa, SciPy, and NumPy to help with audio calculations. We will also be using RubberBand to manipulate our audio files in the time domain. We will need to use cython to make it compatible. RubberBand has been reviewed and people say that it is very powerful and works well, but it also puts a lot of stress on the CPU. If it cannot handle what we need to do, we will use SoundTouch. SOund touch works in the time domain. It runs into problems with overlapping windows, either duplicating or missing some audio. Because of this, RubberBand would be ideal, but if it cannot work, we will use SoundTouch. We will also be looking at SuperPowered for time-stretching and pitch shifting.
